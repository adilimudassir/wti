<p><strong>WHAT IS FOREX TRADING?</strong></p>
<p>Forex is just a Short form for&nbsp;<strong>FOREIGN EXCHANGE</strong>.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange&nbsp; (Forex, FX, or currency market is a global decentralized or Over-The-Counter (OTC) market for the the rading of international currencies such Euros, dollars, pounds, Japanese yen etc. For profit maximization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In layman&rsquo;s terms, FX trading is the act of buying one currency while selling another simultaneously. Currency values are constantly shifting. They can either be rising in value(appreciating) or decreasing in value(depreciating) due to a number of reasons such as economics and politics. The entire goal of people involved in the Foreign Exchange market is to take advantage of these changes and profit from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike most other financial markets, Forex trading can occur 24-hours a day though a global network of businesses, banks and individuals. This means you could be making money even while you sleep. And what&rsquo;s wrong with that?&nbsp;The Online Forex market has great potentials and there are countless numbers of opportunities that come with forex trading.</p>
<p>Forex is one of the largest market in the world with a Total Daily Liquidity of $5.3 Trillion dollars. It is larger than New York Stock Exchange market and the Cryptomarket combined together.</p>

<p class="text-white text-light">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like every Field you try to learn, you would have to get accustomed to its Terms and Terminologies. So for every new field you embark upon in life, you would encounter New Terminologies and terms which is peculiar to such fields. Be it Law, Medicine, Journalism, Engineering etc. you would have to get yourself acquainted with their Terminologies so as to be able to communicate properly.</p>
<p>So also in Forex, for you to be able to Learn and Trade, you would get to know some of the terms that is used in Forex Trading. So that you can understand the New, Flow with your fellow Forex traders and understand Analysts.</p>
<p>You may be among the gathering of Forex Traders but you won&rsquo;t understand a dime of what they are saying. This is because you don&rsquo;t know the terms. So that is what we would be learning in this section</p>
<h2><strong>TERMINOLOGIES USED IN FOREX</strong></h2>
<p><strong>TO GO LONG &ndash; <em>buy</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>TO GO</strong>&nbsp;<strong>SHORT &ndash; <em>sell</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a trader tells you that he went&nbsp;<strong>Long&nbsp;</strong>on a Currency pair. He meant that, he&nbsp;<strong>Bought&nbsp;</strong>the pair.</li>
<li>While if they tell you that they&nbsp;<strong>Short&nbsp;</strong>a Currency pair, it means that they&nbsp;<strong>Sold&nbsp;</strong>the pair.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BULLISH MARKET</strong></p>
<p>A market that is going&nbsp;<em><strong>Upwards</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>BEARISH MARKET</strong></p>
<p>A market that is going&nbsp;<em><strong>Downwards</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>When someone tells you that a currency pair or a commodity is&nbsp;<strong>Bullish&nbsp;</strong>its telling you that its going&nbsp;<strong>Up.</strong></li>
<li>While one that is&nbsp;<strong>Bearish&nbsp;</strong>is going down.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BULLS</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Buyer&nbsp;</strong>are referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Bulls.</strong></p>
<p><strong> BEARS</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sellers&nbsp;</strong>are referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Bears.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RANGING</strong></p>
<p>A market is said to be&nbsp;<strong>Ranging</strong>, if it does not have any particular direction. Its neither moving&nbsp;<strong>Upwards nor Downwards</strong></p>
<p><strong>TRENDING</strong></p>
<p>A market that has a direction. Its ether moving&nbsp;<strong>Upwards or Downwards&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So you can hear people say a market is Trending Upwards or the Market is Trending Downwards. You may hear people tell you that the Market is Just Ranging. They are indirectly telling you that the market is not found any direction yet</p>
<p><strong>HAWKISH</strong></p>
<p>This term is mostly used when referring to the Central Bank Governor or personnel of a country. When they are Hawkish, they tend to be liberal on interest rate and are willing to increase it. This is good news for investors.</p>
<p><strong>DOVISH</strong></p>
<p>This is the opposite of Hawkish. Financial personnel who are Dovish are very restrictive. They do not want to tamper with the interest rate. They even want to reduce it. This is bad news for investors. Like what is happening to Great Britain right now</p>
<p><strong>NFB</strong></p>
<p>An acronym for&nbsp;<strong>Non Farm Payroll</strong>. A very important New Event in the US.</p>
<p>Also most of the Currency pairs have specific names in which they are called. We would get to know them soon.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul>
<li>the dollar is sometimes called Greenback</li>
<li>the Pounds is called cable</li>
<li>the New Zealand dollar is called Kiwi</li>
<li>the Australian dollars is the Aussie etc.</li>
<li>The Canadian Dollars is called the Loonie</li>
<li>Oil is referred to as the Black Gold. Etc</li>
</ul>
<p><br />We would get to know them as we go along with the Training.<br />It\'s just to get you acquainted with the most popular ones so that When you see fellow Forex Traders discussing,&nbsp; U would tag along easily</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we go on with the Training,&nbsp; We would get to see more Terminologies and Explain them as we see them</p>
<p><br />Time Check is far Spent🕙</p>
<p><br />SO WE WOULD BE STOPPING HERE FOR TODAY.</p>
<p>Let\'s ensure we go over the&nbsp; lectures again and again to aid your full understanding of whatever is being taught</p>
<p><br />Soon, you will be a pro!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANK YOU EVERYONE🤝🏼</p>',

<p class="text-white text-light">&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are basically&nbsp;<strong>Two (2)&nbsp;</strong>forms of Trading in Forex. They are sometimes referred to as&nbsp;<strong>ANALYSIS.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Fundamental Analysis</li>
<li>Technical Analysis</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p>Fundamental Analysis is also known as News Trading. Here you are analyzing Forex market with respect to the News. It&rsquo;s been said that News is what moves the market. Everyday various news are being released by these major countries and they either Positively or Negatively affect the Currency pair involved and then you make your Trading decision based on New heard. We see all these news on CNN, Bloomberg, CNBC etc.&nbsp; Also your MT4 App has a Summary of news section. Some sites like forexfactory.com, dailyfx.com etc gives summary of this News.</p>
<p>Whether the News is Positive or Negative as a Forex Trader that is none of your business because you make money both ways. Those into Crypto Trading would tell you that you only make money when a Coin is appreciating but in Forex we make money both ways. If a currency pair is appreciating, we go long on the pair. When a Currency is also depreciating based on News, we go short on the pair. So in Forex, you make money on both sides of the News. (We will come to see how to trade the News Later.</p>
<p>Today we would be discussing an important News Released by the United States even though there are News released every day. This is what we Forex Traders call KING OF ALL NEWS. It is called NFP (NON FARM PAYROLL). This is a news released by the United States of America. Among all the news released by the US, this is the highest because it causes the most Volatility in the market. By Volatility, we mean making the market fluctuate and move in a particular direction most rapidly. Example, in Forex we calculate Profit in PIPS (we talk about pips soon).</p>
<p>Non Farm Payroll is one of the Biggest News that every trader awaits on. It&rsquo;s a News that contains various data and statistics released by the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics. It&rsquo;s very influential as an indicator of US Economy because of the US Federal Reserve makes monetary policy decisions with the News hence, Investors, Financial Analysts, Forex Traders, Stock Traders make trading decisions with the News. It&rsquo;s released every 1st Friday of the Month by 8:30am(EST) that is 12;30pm(GMT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Non Farm Payroll increase. The data include</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;This is the number of new jobs added in the US Labor sector in the previous month. These data includes employment in the manufacturing sector, Construction sector, Goods sector etc.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Excluding Farm workers (hence the name). Also excluding Private Household employees and non- profit organizations. It is usually compared to the previous data.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Example</p>
<p>The one we traded on Friday, September 7th is the number of jobs added in August. It also includes</p>
<p><strong>2. Unemployment rate of the US</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Which sectors of the economy, these jobs were added mostly</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;It gives investors and traders where are the possible sectors to invest in as the sector that added more jobs would be most likely to have experienced growth</li>
</ul>
<p>4. It also includes the Average hourly earnings of the workers in the US. This is also an Economic indicator because even if the number of workers didn&rsquo;t change but however their earnings increased. It would have the same effect as if their number increased. Same also could be interpreted in revision of previous non form payroll because investors compare these values together whether there has been an improvement or reduction. This also gives you an idea of the economy is growing or reducing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;INTERPRETATION OF NFP</strong></p>
<p>When more jobs are added, it means Business ventures are growing and remember that these newly employed would be paid. Hence more people would have money to spend on goods and services hence increasing the growth of the economy. However when the number of Jobs added are reduced. The Reverse occurs. People won&rsquo;t have money to spend on goods produced and service hence dwindling the economy Also the US government has an amount of money paid to the unemployed. When more Jobs are added, more people would be employed. This reduces the unemployment rate, as the unemployed citizens reduce less money leaves the government pockets hence boosting the economy.</p>
<p>This is just a Breakdown of what NFP entails and why it&rsquo;s so volatile. It&rsquo;s usually released 1st Friday of every month. So we would together Trade the Next NFP, because it&rsquo;s seen than explained. No Forex Trading fixes his Wedding or Party on the First Friday of any month except it&rsquo;s a Night event. So as Forex Traders, never miss it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are driving and its 12:20PM (GMT) just park, open your phone Trade your NFP and continue where you are going.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are sick (God forbid), just tell them to give you your phone that Friday, because you can&rsquo;t miss NFP. That how Big it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most traders Trade once a month. They fund their accounts especially for NFP and close for the month. Most people make what you would be in a year just on an NFP afternoon. That&rsquo;s how massive NFP News are. It causes large volatility in the market.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You for Today.See you in our Next Class</strong></p>',

<div class="open_grepper_editor" title="Edit &amp; Save To Grepper">&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>DEFINITION</strong></p>
<p>A currency pair is the quotation of the relative value of a currency unit against the unit of another currency in the foreign exchange market. The currency that is used as the reference is called the counter currency, quote currency or currency and the currency that is quoted in relation is called the base currency or transaction currency.</p>
<p>In other words, Currency pairs are the national currencies from two countries coupled for trading on the foreign exchange (FX) market.&nbsp; Both currencies will have exchange rates on which the trade will have its position basis. All trading within the forex market, whether selling, buying,&nbsp; will take place through currency pairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOW&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>CURRENCY</strong>&nbsp;<strong>PAIRS</strong>&nbsp;<strong>WORK</strong></p>
<p>The currency exchange rates of foreign currency pairs float. This floating rate means that the exchange rate continually changes. These changes can be due to a multitude of factors. The currency pairs serve to set the value of one vs. another, and the exchange rates will continuously fluctuate based on the respective changing values. One currency will always hold stronger than the other.</p>
<h4><strong>MAJOR CURRENCY PAIRS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Major currency pairs</strong>&nbsp;are the most commonly traded, and account for&nbsp;nearly 80% of trade volume on the forex market.<br />These currency pairs could typically have low volatility and high liquidity. E.g EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, AUDUSD<br /><br />They are associated with stable, well managed economies, are less susceptible to manipulation and have smaller spreads than other pairs.</p>
<h4><strong>CROSSES</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Cross currency pairs</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Crosses &ndash; are pairs that do not include the USD.<br />Historically, Crosses were converted first into USD and then into the desired currency, but are now offered for direct exchange.<br /><br />The most commonly traded are derived from Minor currency pairs (e.g. EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY); they are typically less liquid and more volatile than Major currency pairs.</p>
<h4><strong>EXOTIC CURRENCY PAIRS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Exotics</strong>&nbsp;are currencies from emerging or smaller economies, paired with a Major.<br /><br />Compared to Crosses and Majors, Exotics are much riskier to trade because they are less liquid, more volatile, and more susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />They also contain wider spreads, and are more sensitive to sudden shifts in political and financial developments.E.g USD/TRY, USD/MXN, GBP/NOK, GBP/DKK/GBP/ZAR</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://wavecresttradinginstitute.org/portal/courses/page_009.jpg?=93838" width="324" height="294" /></p>
<p>If you look at the currencies listed above you would discover that they are listed in pairs. Among those pairs of Currencies. The&nbsp;<strong>F</strong>irst Currency within the pair is called&nbsp;<strong>BASE CURRENCY&nbsp;</strong>while the&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>econd Currency within the pair is called&nbsp;<strong>QUOTE CURRENCY</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;<strong>EURUSD</strong></p>
<p>The first pair (<strong>EUR</strong>) is called&nbsp;<strong>Base&nbsp;</strong>currency and the second pair (<strong>USD</strong>) is called the&nbsp;<strong>Quote&nbsp;</strong>Currency. Euro is stronger than the US dollar. (I believe we all know that). Hence EURO is the Base while USD is the Quote.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that the&nbsp;<strong>Base&nbsp;</strong>Currency is always&nbsp;<strong>stronger&nbsp;</strong>than the&nbsp;<strong>Quote&nbsp;</strong>Currency (with few exceptions and we would see why soon).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://wavecresttradinginstitute.org/portal/courses/page_0101.jpg?=93838" width="340" height="312" /></p>
<p>While in the second example (<strong>USDJPY</strong>) USD is the Base while Japanese Yen is the Quote because the USD is stronger than Japanese Yen.</p>
<p><img src="https://wavecresttradinginstitute.org/portal/courses/page_010.jpg?=93838" /></p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Also in USDJPY you are seeing 112.94, this number is telling you how many&nbsp;<strong>Units&nbsp;</strong>of the Quote Currency you will need to get 1 Unit of the Base Currency.</p>
<p>Let us a Local scenario to give an example. If you have a Currency pair between USD and Naira</p>
<p>USD/NGN &hellip;.360</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is first telling you that USD is stronger than Naira hence USD is the Base and Naira the Quote.</p>
<p>The next important thing it is telling you how many Quote currencies do you need to get 1 Unit of the Base Currency. So in this case you will need 360 Naira to be able to get 1 US dollar</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTIONS WHERE THE QUOTE IS STRONGER THAN THE BASE CURRENCY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://wavecresttradinginstitute.org/portal/courses/page_012.jpg?=93838" /></p>
<p><strong>Picture 4&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There are occasions in which the stronger ones are written as the second pair. Example include</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*AUDUSD</strong></li>
<li><strong>US dollar is stronger than Australian dollars</strong></li>
<li><strong>*EURGBP</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pounds is stronger than Euro</strong></li>
<li><strong>*USDCHF</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Swis Franc is stronger than USD&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you see these few exceptions don&rsquo;t bother too much about why the weaker one is written first even though it&rsquo;s quite glaring that the Quote is Stronger. What you need to do is look at those numbers beside it (Picture 4). All the numbers that starts with 0.yyyyy (ie Zero point something) are exceptions. In them the Quote is stronger. It doesn&rsquo;t affect your Trading. It&rsquo;s just for knowledge sake.</p>
<p>However apart from those few exceptions generally in Forex the Base is always stronger than the Quote.</p>',

<p><strong>Picture 5</strong></p>
<p>We only do two things in Forex.. We&nbsp;<strong>BUY&nbsp;</strong>and we&nbsp;<strong>SELL&nbsp;</strong>these currency pairs.</p>
<p>The Big question is&nbsp;<strong>Now&nbsp;</strong>when Do you Buy and When do you Sell. This is where people always get confused because those who taught them used the wrong semantics.</p>
<ul>
<li>YOU BUY WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE MARKET&nbsp;<strong>WOULD&nbsp;</strong>GO UP WHILE</li>
<li>YOU SELL WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE MARKET&nbsp;<strong>WOULD&nbsp;</strong>GO DOWN</li>
</ul>
<p>If you notice, I carefully labeled&nbsp;<strong>WOULD</strong>. I didn&rsquo;t say you buy when the market is going Up.</p>
<p>Assuming I said that, I would still be correct but you would get more confused. You would start asking, who buys any item when it&rsquo;s going Up.</p>
<p>As usual, I would use a Local scenario to explain this topic, by the time I&rsquo;m done this seemingly complex concept would look very easy to you. Believe me nothing is hard in Forex. Just tell yourself that if young boys who are not even half educated as you can do this then you too can do it.</p>
<p>Let me use this Analogy to explain what I mean, For those of you who are not Nigerians</p>
<p>I would use 2 names in this brief Analogy.</p>
<p>Name 1: Buhari (He is the current president of Nigeria) Name 2: Jonathan (former president)</p>
<p>Lets get to the Analogy so as to understand in a layman&rsquo;s way of how Forex actually works. When Jonathan was in Power, Dollar was at a time around 180 Naira to 220 Naira. Let&rsquo;s just take the average and say 200 Naira.</p>
<p>When Buhari entered power some of you would recall that around 2016, at some point the dollar shut up to 500 Naira per one</p>
<p>Assuming you knew Dollar would appreciate against Naira like this and you had 2 Million Naira lying fallow in the Bank account. You knew from your experience as a Forex trader that uncertainty in Government weakens a currency pair and you used this your 2 million and bought dollars and kept in 2015</p>
<p>It would give you about $10,000.</p>
<p>1 year later, Dollar just escalated to 500 Naira per dollar and you went to the Bank cashed $10,000 and exchanged it back to Naira.</p>
<p>It would now yield you 5 million Naira (remember you just stocked 2 million Naira) that means you made 3 million Naira Profit.</p>
<p>Ask yourself did you use that 2 million Naira to do any Business? The answer is No. you practically did nothing. What you just did right here was Forex. You leveraged on the fluctuations in the Price of Dollar to Naira to make yourself Money without doing anything. You just sat at home while the Foreign Exchange market did the job for you.</p>
<p>This is basically what we do in Forex. This is not the normal market Oshodi or Idumota, Kaneshie market, Accra Mall etc. that you Buy and Sell clothes. For some that would as what you Buying and Selling.</p>
<p>This is just a raw Analogy because in Forex market it&rsquo;s even more interesting. You don&rsquo;t have to wait 1 year or months to make Money. These Currencies are constantly Fluctuating in minutes (what I usually refer to as Volatility) so it&rsquo;s those opportunities caused by these Fluctuations in the Price of one Currency with respect to another that Forex traders make their money from because they happen daily.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Banks would never allow you to learn Forex. They prefer you come to their Banks and fix the money for meager interest rates. To even shock you, investment Banks contribute more than 70% of the total Liquidity in Forex. They use your money to Trade. Drive big cars and Live in Big Houses and give you peanuts as interest or meager amounts as Salary.</p>
<p>In the above Analogy you would notice that you didn&rsquo;t really Buy or Sell any real commodity to make money. You took advantage of the exchange in Exchange rate to make money.</p>
<p>Why did you Buy&nbsp;<strong>USD/NGN?</strong></p>
<p>In the above scenario, you bought USDNGN because you knew beforehand that the value&nbsp;<strong>Would&nbsp;</strong>rise. Take note&nbsp;<strong>Would.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We would also be touching our Next topic which is MT4 interface. Let me show you guys where to see the&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>uy and&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>ell button.</p>

<p><img src="https://wavecresttradinginstitute.org/portal/courses/page_015.jpg?=93838" /></p>
<p>Click on that icon labeled by the<strong>&nbsp;Red arrow</strong>&nbsp;on any page you are currently on. It would bring you to Chart interface. While on the Chart interface click that icon pointed at the&nbsp;<strong>Purple arrow</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://wavecresttradinginstitute.org/portal/courses/page_016.jpg?=93838" /></p>
<p>As you click on that icon, it would now bring you to this Page where you can Place your&nbsp;<strong>Buy&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Sell&nbsp;</strong>order on any Currency pair you want to trade on</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>In Summary</strong></p>
<p>We have seen that we Buy when we know a Currency pair&nbsp;<strong>Would&nbsp;</strong>rise And we Sell when we know a currency&nbsp;<strong>Would&nbsp;</strong>fall</p>
<p>The Big Question is, how do we know when it would rise and when it would fall.</p>
<p>That is what Technical Analysis would tell you. Technical analysis such as</p>
<p>Candlesticks,Fibonacci ,Elliott waves ,Indicators , Pivot point etc.</p>
<p>We will soon get there, Just follow me step by step</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we would be stopping here for today...</p>
